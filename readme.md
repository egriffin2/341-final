# Final Project
### HERE WE GO...
<ul>
<li>OKAY so first, I began by using the Week 11 assignment as a starting point, as was recommended in one of Nick's emails.
  The topic I chose for that assignment was already one that had enough information along with it to turn into a four page site, so I decided that that would probably be the best route to take. This provided not only good content, but also a pre-made framework for the final as long as I created a parallax page, which is ultimately what I chose to do.  Also, I wanted to use parallax because I think that it is far more aesthetically pleasing and interesting than a normal web page.<br>
  Going into this I was terrified that I was going to absolutely bomb this final project.  Considering how long it can take to do the weekly assignments, I was concerned that this was going to be a complete disaster and that I would not have time to do it well.  I was right in that I did end up being down to the wire on time, but I got a better start on it than I was expecting to.
