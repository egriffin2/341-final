# Final Project
### HERE WE GO...
<ul>
<li>OKAY so first, I began by using the Week 11 assignment as a starting point, as was recommended in one of Nick's emails.
  The topic I chose for that assignment was already one that had enough information along with it to turn into a four page site, so I decided that that would probably be the best route to take. This provided not only good content, but also a pre-made framework for the final as long as I created a parallax page, which is ultimately what I chose to do.  Also, I wanted to use parallax because I think that it is far more aesthetically pleasing and interesting than a normal web page.<br>
  Going into this I was terrified that I was going to absolutely bomb this final project.  Considering how long it can take to do the weekly assignments, I was concerned that this was going to be a complete disaster and that I would not have time to do it well.  I was right in that I did end up being down to the wire on time, but I got a better start on it than I was expecting to.

<li>The first thing I had to do on this project was go back to the very first lesson and look over the instructions again in order to correctly set up my new repository.  I felt kind of ridiculous doing this but I don't set up new repositories often enough to remember all the steps to go through, even though it's an incredibly simple task.</li>

<li>Once I got the structure of this project more or less laid out, I started adding in things like the dropdown menu and google map, just so that there was a little bit more to the site.  I did these things mostly by going back through old projects and seeing what I'd included that I liked.</li>

<li>To my surprise, linking the parts of my parallax site was really easy.  Dealing with parallax kind of intimidates me but this was actually no problem at all.  I looked for some sample code on Google and found <a href = "http://www.turnwall.com/articles/adding-single-page-scrolling-navigation-to-your-site/">this.</a> Once I gave ids to the separate sections of the page it was no problem.</li>

<li>One problem I had was with my map, which was showing up at a low opacity just like its background. This, like many problems I have had in this class, was the result of a tiny mistake, in this case a misplaced tag.</li>
